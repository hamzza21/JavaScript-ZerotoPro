JavaScript is an interpreted language, which means that the computer understands it while running it. 
Some languages get processed beforerunning, this is called compiling, but not JavaScript. The computer can just
interpret JavaScript on the fly. The "engine" that understands JavaScript will be called the interpreter here.
When dealing with JavaScript, you will come across the term ECMAScript
sooner or later. This is the specification or standardization for the JavaScript
language. The current standard is ECMAScript 6 (also referred to as ES6).
Browsers use this specification to support JavaScript (in addition to some
other topics such as Document Object Model (DOM)

console.log('hamza')

Two ways to link JavaScript to a webpage:

Directly in HTML
Here is an example of how to write a very simple web page that will give a
pop-up box saying Hi there! :
<html>
 <script type="text/javascript">
 alert("Hi there!");
 </script>
</html>
Then we are going to create a separate HTML file (using the postfix .html
again). And we are going to give it this content:
<html>
 <script type="text/javascript" src="ch1_alert.js"></script>
</html>

Prompt
Another thing we would like to show you here is also a command prompt. It
works very much like an alert, but instead, it takes input from the user. We
will learn how to store variables very soon, and once you know that, you
can store the result of this prompt function and do something with it. Go
// I'm a single line comment
// console.log("single line comment, not logged");
/* I'm a multi-line comment. Whatever is between the slash aster
console.log("I'm not logged, because I'm a comment");
*/
ahead and change the alert() to a prompt() in the Hi.html file, for
example, like this:
prompt("Hi! How are you?");

Random numbers
For the purpose of fun exercises in the early chapters of this book, we
would like you to know how to generate a random number in JavaScript. It
is absolutely fine if you don't really understand what is going on just yet;
just know that this is the command to create a random number:
Math.random();
We can do it in the console and see the result appear if we log it:
console.log(Math.random());
This number will be a decimal between 0 and 1. If we want a number
between 0 and 100, we can multiply it by 100, like this:
console.log(Math.random() * 100);
Don't worry, we will cover mathematic operators in Chapter 2, JavaScript
Essentials.
If we don't want to have a decimal result, we can use the Math.floor
function on it, which is rounding it down to the nearest integer:
console.log(Math.floor(Math.random() * 100));
Don't worry about not getting this yet. This will be explained in more detail
further on in the book. In Chapter 8, Built-In JavaScript Methods, we will
discuss built-in methods in more detail. Until then, just trust us that this
does generate a random number between 0 and 100.
